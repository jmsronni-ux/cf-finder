## Testing the System

### Test Registration Flow:
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Click "Register" button
3. Fill in test user details
4. Submit and verify success message
5. Check that user cannot log in yet

### Test Admin Approval:
1. Log in as admin user
2. Go to Admin Panel → Registration Requests
3. Verify new request appears in pending list
4. Click "Approve"
5. Verify success message
6. Check that approved request moves to approved list
7. Test that new user can now log in

### Test Admin Rejection:
1. Submit another test registration
2. As admin, view in registration requests
3. Enter a rejection reason
4. Click "Reject"
5. Verify rejection appears in rejected list

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send confirmation email when request is submitted
   - Notify user when approved/rejected
   - Include rejection reason in rejection email

2. **Additional User Information**
   - Address fields
   - ID verification
   - Profile picture upload

3. **Bulk Actions**
   - Approve/reject multiple requests at once
   - Export registration data to CSV

## Important Notes

- Registration requests are stored separately from user accounts
- When a request is approved, a new user account is created automatically
- Rejected requests can be deleted but remain in the database until manually removed
- Users can resubmit if their previous request was rejected
- All passwords are hashed before storage using bcrypt
- Admin actions are logged with reviewer information and timestamps

## Support

For any issues or questions about the registration system:
1. Check the browser console for frontend errors
2. Check backend server logs for API errors
3. Verify MongoDB connection is active
4. Ensure admin user has `isAdmin: true` in the database
5. Confirm JWT tokens are being sent correctly
