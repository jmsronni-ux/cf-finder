## Technical Stack

- **Confetti**: `canvas-confetti` library
- **Animations**: Motion (Framer Motion)
- **Navigation**: React Router with state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients

## Animation Details

### Confetti Timing:
- 0ms: Initial center burst (100 particles)
- 250ms: Second burst (100 particles)
- 500ms: Third burst (100 particles)
- 750ms: Left side burst (50 particles)
- 1000ms: Right side burst (50 particles)

### Popup Animations:
- Scale: 0.5 â†’ 1.0 (spring physics)
- Opacity: 0 â†’ 1
- Y-position: 50px â†’ 0px
- Icon rotation: -180Â° â†’ 0Â°

## Customization

### To change confetti colors:
Edit the confetti options in `WithdrawSuccessPopup.tsx`:
```typescript
confettiRef.current?.fire({
  particleCount: 100,
  spread: 70,
  colors: ['#10b981', '#34d399', '#6ee7b7'] // Your colors here
});
```

### To adjust animation speed:
Modify the transition duration in motion components:
```typescript
transition={{ 
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 260,  // Higher = faster
  damping: 20,     // Lower = more bounce
  duration: 0.5    // Overall duration
}}
```

### To change popup colors:
Update the gradient classes in the component:
```typescript
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0a0a0a] via-[#0f0f0f] to-[#0a0a0a] border-2 border-green-500/30"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Confetti not showing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `canvas-confetti` is installed
- Make sure ref is properly initialized

### Popup not appearing?
- Check navigation state in React DevTools
- Verify useEffect is running in UserProfile
- Ensure withdrawal was actually approved

### Animations choppy?
- Enable GPU acceleration in browser
- Reduce confetti particle count
- Check system performance
