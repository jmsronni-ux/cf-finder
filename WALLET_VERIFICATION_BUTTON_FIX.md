# Wallet Verification Button Implementation - FIXED

## Issue Found
The "Verify Wallet" button wasn't showing even when `user.walletVerified` was `false`. 

## Root Cause
The backend `/tier/my-tier` endpoint was NOT returning the `walletVerified` field in the user data response, so the frontend never received this information.

## Fix Applied

### Backend Fix
**File:** `backend/controllers/tier.controller.js`

Added `walletVerified` field to the user data returned by the `/tier/my-tier` endpoint:

```javascript
user: {
    id: user._id,
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email,
    tier: user.tier,
    balance: user.balance,
    isAdmin: user.isAdmin,
    walletVerified: user.walletVerified,  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
    lvl1anim: user.lvl1anim,
    // ... rest of fields
}
```

### Frontend Implementation
**Files Modified:**
1. `frontend/src/components/ui/pulsating-button.tsx` - Added two new variants:
   - `verifyWallet`: Green button with wallet icon
   - `verificationPending`: Yellow pulsing button (like upgradePending)

2. `frontend/src/components/FlowCanvas.tsx`:
   - Added `hasPendingVerification` state to track pending verification requests
   - Added `useEffect` to fetch verification status from `/wallet-verification/my-requests`
   - Updated button variant logic with proper priority order
   - Admin users bypass wallet verification requirement

## Button Logic Flow

### Priority Order (Top to Bottom):
1. **Tier Upgrade Pending** → Show "Upgrade Pending" (yellow pulsing)
2. **Animation Completed** → Show "Withdraw" 
3. **Verification Pending** (non-admin) → Show "Verification Pending" (yellow pulsing, disabled)
4. **Wallet Not Verified** (non-admin) → Show "Verify Wallet" (green, clickable) ✅
5. **Animation Running** → Show "Running..." (loading)
6. **Default** → Show "Start Animation"

### User Flow:
1. User without verified wallet sees **green "Verify Wallet"** button
2. Click button → Navigate to `/profile` page
3. User submits verification request on profile page
4. Return to dashboard → Button shows **yellow "Verification Pending"**
5. Admin approves verification
6. Button shows normal state: "Start Animation" or "Withdraw"

### Admin Bypass:
- Admin users (`user.isAdmin === true`) bypass wallet verification entirely
- They can start animations without wallet verification

## Testing

### Debug Console Logs Added
Temporary debug logging in FlowCanvas.tsx shows:
- `user?.walletVerified`
- `user?.isAdmin`
- `hasWatchedCurrentLevel`
- `hasPendingVerification`
- `pendingTierRequest`
- `hasStarted`

These can be removed after testing confirms everything works.

## What to Test:

1. ✅ Regular user without verified wallet → Should see "Verify Wallet" button
2. ✅ Click "Verify Wallet" → Should navigate to profile
3. ✅ Submit verification request → Return to dashboard, should see "Verification Pending"
4. ✅ Admin user → Should bypass verification, see "Start Animation"
5. ✅ After admin approval → User should see normal buttons again

## Files Changed:
- `backend/controllers/tier.controller.js` - Added walletVerified to API response
- `frontend/src/components/ui/pulsating-button.tsx` - Added new variants
- `frontend/src/components/FlowCanvas.tsx` - Updated button logic & added verification check
