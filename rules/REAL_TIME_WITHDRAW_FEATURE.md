# Real-Time Withdraw Request Feature

## Overview
Implemented a real-time withdraw request system where users submit requests and see live updates when admins approve them, including the confirmed wallet address and amount.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. Updated Withdraw Request Model (`backend/models/withdraw-request.model.js`)
Added new fields:
```javascript
confirmedWallet: String    // Admin-confirmed wallet address
confirmedAmount: Number    // Admin-confirmed amount
```

#### B. Updated Approve Controller (`backend/controllers/withdraw-request.controller.js`)
- Admin must provide `confirmedWallet` and `confirmedAmount` when approving
- Validates admin inputs before approval
- Deducts the confirmed amount (not the requested amount) from user balance
- Saves confirmed values to the request

**API Request Format:**
```javascript
PUT /withdraw-request/{requestId}/approve
Body: {
  confirmedWallet: "0x123...",
  confirmedAmount: 100.00
}
```

### 2. Admin Panel Updates (`frontend/src/pages/AdminWithdrawRequests.tsx`)

#### Added Input Fields for Pending Requests:
- **Confirmed Wallet Address** input field
- **Confirmed Amount** input field
- Purple-tinted confirmation section
- Shows requested values as reference
- Validation before approval

#### Display Confirmed Details:
- Shows confirmed wallet and amount for approved requests
- Green-tinted success section
- Distinguishes between requested and confirmed values

**Admin Workflow:**
1. View pending withdraw request
2. See user's requested amount and wallet
3. Fill in confirmed wallet address
4. Fill in confirmed amount
5. Click approve
6. User sees the confirmed details instantly

### 3. WithdrawPopup Real-Time Updates (`frontend/src/components/WithdrawPopup.tsx`)

#### Four States:

**A. IDLE State (Initial Form)**
- User enters amount and wallet address
- Submit button to create request
- Shows available balance

**B. PENDING State (After Submission)**
- Shows spinning loader icon
- **"🔒 Don't Close This Window!"** message
- Displays requested amount and wallet
- Polls backend every 3 seconds for status updates
- **Popup stays open** until approved/rejected

**C. APPROVED State (After Admin Approves)**
- Shows green success checkmark
- **Displays admin-confirmed wallet address**
- **Displays admin-confirmed amount**
- Message: "Funds will be sent to the above wallet address shortly"
- Close button to dismiss

**D. REJECTED State (If Admin Rejects)**
- Shows red X icon
- Rejection message
- Close button to dismiss

#### Real-Time Polling:
- Starts polling when status is 'pending'
- Checks status every 3 seconds
- Automatically updates UI when status changes
- Stops polling when approved/rejected
- Cleans up interval on component unmount

```

## Technical Implementation

### Polling Mechanism
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (requestStatus === 'pending' && pendingRequest) {
    const checkStatus = async () => {
      // Fetch latest request status
      const response = await fetch('/withdraw-request/my-requests');
      const currentRequest = data.find(req => req._id === pendingRequest._id);
      
      if (currentRequest.status !== 'pending') {
        // Update UI with new status
        setPendingRequest(currentRequest);
        setRequestStatus(currentRequest.status);
        clearInterval(pollingInterval);
      }
    };

    const interval = setInterval(checkStatus, 3000); // Poll every 3s
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [requestStatus, pendingRequest]);
```

### State Management
- **idle**: Initial form state
- **pending**: Request submitted, waiting for admin
- **approved**: Admin approved, show confirmed details
- **rejected**: Admin rejected request

### Data Flow
```
User Submit → Backend Creates Request → User Sees Pending
                                              ↓
                                         Polling Starts
                                              ↓
Admin Approves → Backend Updates Request → Polling Detects Change
                                              ↓
                                         User Sees Approved
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Validation**: Admin must provide both wallet and amount
2. **Balance Check**: Backend validates user has sufficient balance for confirmed amount
3. **Token Authentication**: All requests require valid auth token
4. **Polling Rate Limit**: 3-second intervals prevent server overload
5. **Status Immutability**: Can't approve/reject already processed requests

## UI/UX Highlights

### Visual Feedback
- **Yellow** for pending (with pulsing loader)
- **Green** for approved (with checkmark)
- **Red** for rejected (with X icon)
- **Lock emoji** 🔒 emphasizes "don't close" message

### User Guidance
- Clear messaging at each state
- Shows both requested and confirmed values
- "Don't close" warning prevents premature closing
- Confirmation dialog if user tries to close during pending state

### Admin Experience
- Input fields clearly labeled
- Shows requested values as reference
- Validation prevents empty submissions
- Success toast on approval
- Cleared inputs after successful approval

## API Endpoints

### User Endpoints
```
POST /withdraw-request/create        - Submit withdrawal request
GET  /withdraw-request/my-requests   - Get user's requests (for polling)
```

### Admin Endpoints
```
GET  /withdraw-request/all          - Get all requests
PUT  /withdraw-request/:id/approve  - Approve with confirmed details
PUT  /withdraw-request/:id/reject   - Reject request
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Users see approval instantly without refreshing
2. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what admin confirmed
3. **Flexibility**: Admin can adjust amount or wallet if needed
4. **Better UX**: No need to check email or refresh page
5. **Trust Building**: Immediate feedback builds user confidence
6. **Reduced Support**: Clear communication reduces confusion

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with WebSocket for true real-time updates
2. **Notification Sound**: Play sound when approved
3. **Email Notification**: Send email with confirmed details
4. **Transaction ID**: Include blockchain transaction ID once sent
5. **History View**: Show past withdraw requests in popup
6. **Admin Notes**: Allow admin to add notes that user can see
7. **Rejection Reason**: Show why request was rejected
