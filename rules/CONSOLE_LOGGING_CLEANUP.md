# Console Logging Cleanup

## Problem
The browser console was being flooded with hundreds of repeated log messages, primarily from `FlowCanvas.tsx:571` showing "Level 1 reward from user: 300 User object: {...}" repeatedly.

## Root Cause
A `console.log()` statement was placed inside a render function that was being executed on every component render, causing massive console spam.

## Files Cleaned Up

### 1. `frontend/src/components/FlowCanvas.tsx`

**Removed:**
- **Line 155:** `console.log('Animation completed for level', currentLevel);`
  - This was in a useEffect but unnecessary for production
  
- **Line 571:** `console.log(\`Level ${currentLevel} reward from user:\`, reward, 'User object:', user);`
  - **THIS WAS THE MAIN CULPRIT** - inside a render function, executed on every re-render
  - Caused hundreds of repeated log messages

### 2. `frontend/src/components/NodeDetailsPanel.tsx`

**Removed:**
- Line 35: `console.log('NodeDetailsPanel: No token or user, skipping tier fetch');`
- Line 39: `console.log('NodeDetailsPanel: Fetching tier info for user tier:', user.tier);`
- Line 49: `console.log('NodeDetailsPanel: Tier info response:', json);`
- Line 53: `console.log('NodeDetailsPanel: Setting next tier info:', nextTier);`
- Line 60: `console.log('NodeDetailsPanel: No upgrade options available');`
- Line 73: `console.log('handleUpgradeClick called', { nextTierInfo, user: !!user, token: !!token });`

**Kept:**
- Line 58: `console.error('NodeDetailsPanel: Failed to fetch tier info', e);`
  - Error logs are useful for debugging and don't spam

### 3. `frontend/src/components/WithdrawPopup.tsx`

**No changes needed** - the console.log statements in this file are:
- Only executed when specific conditions are met (max tier or duplicate request)
- Not in render loops
- Useful for debugging edge cases

## Best Practices Applied

✅ **Removed debug logs from production code**
- Console logs left over from development should be removed

✅ **Never log inside render functions**
- Logging in render functions causes massive console spam
- Use React DevTools for component debugging instead

✅ **Kept error logs**
- `console.error()` statements for actual errors are kept
- These are important for debugging production issues

✅ **Removed logs in high-frequency code paths**
- Logs in useEffects that run frequently
- Logs in frequently called functions

## Result

Console is now clean with only relevant error messages and intentional logs. Performance should also be slightly improved as logging operations have overhead.

## Testing

After these changes:
1. Console should be much cleaner
2. No repeated log messages
3. Only errors and important events will be logged
4. No linting errors introduced
