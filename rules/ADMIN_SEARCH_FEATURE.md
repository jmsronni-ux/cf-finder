# Admin User Rewards - Search & Filter Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the Admin User Rewards page with search, filter, and sort capabilities to handle large numbers of users efficiently.

## Features Added

### 1. Search Bar
**Location**: Top of the user list, below the header

**Functionality**:
- Real-time search as you type
- Searches across:
  - User names
  - Email addresses
  - User IDs
- Case-insensitive matching
- Clear button (X) to reset search instantly

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');

const filteredUsers = users.filter((userData) => {
  if (!searchQuery.trim()) return true;
  
  const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
  return (
    userData.name.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    userData.email.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    userData._id.toLowerCase().includes(query)
  );
});
```

### 2. Sort Options
**Location**: Dropdown next to the search bar

**Available Sort Options**:
- **By Date (Newest)** - Default, shows recently added users first
- **By Name (A-Z)** - Alphabetically by user name
- **By Email (A-Z)** - Alphabetically by email
- **By Tier (Highest)** - Shows highest tier users first
- **By Balance (Highest)** - Shows users with most balance first

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'name' | 'email' | 'tier' | 'balance' | 'date'>('date');

const sortedUsers = filteredUsers.sort((a, b) => {
  switch (sortBy) {
    case 'name':
      return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);
    case 'email':
      return a.email.localeCompare(b.email);
    case 'tier':
      return b.tier - a.tier;
    case 'balance':
      return b.balance - a.balance;
    case 'date':
    default:
      return new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime();
  }
});
```

### 3. Statistics Display
**Location**: Bottom of search bar card

**Shows**:
- **Total Users**: Count of all users in the system
- **Filtered Results**: Count of users matching search (only shown when searching)

**Visual Design**:
- Icons for visual clarity (User icon for total, Search icon for filtered)
- Color-coded text (blue for total, green for filtered)
- Updates in real-time as you search

### 4. Empty State Messages
**Enhanced empty states**:
- **No results found**: Shows when search returns no matches
  - "No users match your search"
  - "Try a different search term"
- **No users**: Shows when database has no users
  - "No users found"

### 5. Responsive Design
- Search bar and sort dropdown stack vertically on mobile
- Full width on desktop with optimal spacing
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Finding a Specific User
1. Admin navigates to User Rewards page
2. Sees stats: "Total Users: 150"
3. Types user's name in search: "john"
4. Stats update: "Filtered: 3"
5. Sees 3 users with "john" in name or email
6. Edits the desired user's rewards

### Scenario 2: Reviewing High-Tier Users
1. Admin opens User Rewards page
2. Changes sort to "Sort by Tier (Highest)"
3. Sees all Tier 5 users first
4. Reviews and adjusts their level rewards as needed

### Scenario 3: Finding Users by Email Domain
1. Admin wants to find all @company.com users
2. Types "@company.com" in search
3. Instantly sees all matching users
4. Can bulk review their reward settings

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Considerations
- **Client-side filtering**: All filtering happens in the browser for instant results
- **Efficient re-renders**: Only filtered list re-renders on search change
- **Optimized sorting**: Uses native JavaScript sort methods
- **No API calls**: Search and sort don't require server requests

### State Management
```typescript
const [users, setUsers] = useState<UserData[]>([]); // All users from API
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(''); // Search input
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'name' | 'email' | 'tier' | 'balance' | 'date'>('date');

// Computed filtered and sorted list
const filteredUsers = users
  .filter(/* search logic */)
  .sort(/* sort logic */);
```

### UI Components Used
- `Input` - For search field (from shadcn/ui)
- `Card` & `CardContent` - For search bar container
- `Search` icon - From lucide-react
- `X` icon - For clear button
- Native `<select>` - For sort dropdown (styled to match theme)

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Can handle hundreds or thousands of users efficiently
2. **User-friendly**: Instant feedback as admin types
3. **Flexible**: Multiple ways to find and organize users
4. **Professional**: Clean, modern UI matching the rest of the admin panel
5. **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, clear labels, and responsive design

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Advanced Filters**:
   - Filter by tier (checkboxes)
   - Filter by balance range (min/max)
   - Filter by completed levels
   - Filter by date range

2. **Pagination**:
