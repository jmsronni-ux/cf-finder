# Automatic Tier Upgrade Request on Successful Withdrawal

## Overview
When a user successfully completes a withdrawal (withdrawal request is approved by admin), the system now automatically submits a tier upgrade request to the next available tier. This eliminates the need for users to manually request tier upgrades after successful withdrawals.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made to `frontend/src/components/WithdrawPopup.tsx`

1. **Added Auth Context**
   - Imported `useAuth` hook to access user data and authentication token
   - Added `user` and `token` from auth context

2. **New State Management**
   - Added `tierRequestSubmittedRef` ref to prevent duplicate tier upgrade submissions
   - This ensures the tier upgrade is only requested once per withdrawal approval

3. **Auto-Submit Function: `submitAutomaticTierUpgrade()`**
   - Checks if user is at max tier (tier 5) - if so, skips tier upgrade
   - Fetches next available tier information from `/tier/my-tier` endpoint
   - Automatically submits tier upgrade request to `/tier-request/create` endpoint
   - Shows success toast notification: "ðŸŽ‰ Tier upgrade request for [Tier Name] automatically submitted!"
   - Handles edge cases:
     - If user already has a pending tier request, silently ignores (no error toast)
     - If any other error occurs, shows info toast instead of error
   - Prevents duplicate submissions using the ref flag

4. **Integration with Withdrawal Approval**
   - The function is called in the polling `checkStatus` function when withdrawal status changes to 'approved'
   - Happens after `onSuccess()` callback is executed
   - Runs automatically in the background without user intervention

5. **Cleanup Logic**
   - Resets `tierRequestSubmittedRef` when popup closes (if not in pending state)
   - Ensures fresh state for next withdrawal attempt

## User Experience Flow

1. User submits withdrawal request
2. Popup shows "Pending" state while waiting for admin approval
3. Admin approves withdrawal in admin panel
4. Popup automatically detects approval (via polling every 3 seconds)
5. **NEW:** Tier upgrade request is automatically submitted
6. User sees success message for withdrawal approval
7. User sees automatic tier upgrade notification
8. Popup shows payment instructions
9. User can close popup - tier request will be visible in profile/dashboard

## Benefits

âœ… **Seamless UX**: Users don't need to manually navigate and request tier upgrades  
âœ… **Automatic**: Happens in the background without user action  
âœ… **Smart**: Only submits if user is not at max tier  
âœ… **Safe**: Prevents duplicate submissions  
âœ… **Graceful**: Handles errors silently without disrupting user experience  
âœ… **Informative**: Shows success toast when tier upgrade is submitted  

## Edge Cases Handled

- âœ… User already at max tier (tier 5) - skips automatic upgrade
- âœ… User already has pending tier request - doesn't show error
- âœ… Network errors during tier upgrade submission - logged but not shown to user
- âœ… Multiple withdrawal approvals - prevents duplicate tier requests via ref flag
- âœ… No next tier available - gracefully skips

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing tier request API endpoints (no backend changes needed)
- Leverages existing auth context and token management
- Maintains separation of concerns - withdrawal and tier upgrade are separate operations
- Non-blocking - withdrawal success is not dependent on tier upgrade submission
