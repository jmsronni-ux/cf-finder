# Level Animation System - Status Report

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **level-two.json** - Added missing closing brace
2. **Node Visibility** - Only center node shows before first animation
3. **Animation Flow** - Cumulative progress through levels

## üìä Level JSON File Structure:

### Level Distribution:
- **level-one.json**: 25 nodes, 24 edges
  - 18 nodes at level 1
  - 7 nodes at level 2
  
- **level-two.json**: 25 nodes, 24 edges  
  - 18 nodes at level 1
  - 7 nodes at level 2

- **level-three.json**: 26 nodes
  - 18 nodes at level 1
  - 7 nodes at level 2
  - 1 node at level 3

- **level-four.json**: 27 nodes
  - 18 nodes at level 1
  - 7 nodes at level 2
  - 1 node at level 3
  - 1 node at level 4

- **level-five.json**: 28 nodes
  - 18 nodes at level 1
  - 7 nodes at level 2
  - 1 node at level 3
  - 1 node at level 4
  - 1 node at level 5

## üé¨ Animation Flow Design:

### Tier 1 (Level 1):
1. **Initial State**: Only center account node visible
2. **Click "Start Animation"**: 
   - 6 crypto nodes (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, BNB, TRX) animate from center
   - 18 fingerprint nodes branch out from crypto nodes
3. **After Animation**: All level 1 nodes remain visible and unlocked
4. **DB**: `lvl1anim = 1`

### Tier 2 (Level 2):
1. **Load level-two.json**: System switches to level-two.json data
2. **Initial State**: 
   - All 18 level 1 nodes visible (already unlocked, `lvl1anim = 1`)
   - Center and crypto nodes visible
   - Level 2 fingerprint nodes hidden until animation
3. **Click "Start Animation"**:
   - 7 level 2 fingerprint nodes animate (children of level 1 nodes)
4. **After Animation**: All level 1 + 2 nodes visible
5. **DB**: `lvl2anim = 1`

### Tier 3-5:
- Same pattern continues
- Previous levels remain visible
- New level nodes animate
- Cumulative progress saved in DB

## üîß Visibility System Logic:

```javascript
// Before animation (hasStarted = false):
- Show only center node
- Hide all other nodes

// During animation (hasStarted = true, lvlXanim = 0):
- Show center node
- Animate nodes as they appear in sequence
- Hide nodes not yet reached in animation

// After watching (lvlXanim = 1):
- Show all nodes from that level immediately
- No hiding/animation needed for watched levels
```

## ‚úÖ Test Checklist:

### New User (Tier 0 ‚Üí Tier 1):
- [ ] Dashboard loads with only center node visible
- [ ] Click "Start Animation" triggers level 1 animation
- [ ] Nodes animate from center outward
- [ ] After completion, all level 1 nodes remain visible
- [ ] Refresh page ‚Üí All level 1 nodes still visible (lvl1anim = 1)

### Upgrade to Tier 2:
- [ ] All level 1 nodes remain visible (unlocked)
- [ ] Level 2 nodes hidden until animation
- [ ] Click "Start Animation" triggers level 2 animation only
- [ ] Level 2 nodes animate from level 1 parent nodes
- [ ] After completion, all level 1+2 nodes visible
- [ ] Refresh page ‚Üí All level 1+2 nodes still visible

### Upgrade to Tier 3-5:
- [ ] Same cumulative pattern
- [ ] Previous levels stay unlocked
- [ ] Only new level animates
- [ ] Refresh preserves all progress

## üéØ Current Status:

**Working:**
‚úÖ JSON files are valid (level-two.json fixed)
‚úÖ Visibility logic hides all nodes except center before animation
‚úÖ Animation system tracks which levels have been watched
‚úÖ Cumulative structure in JSON files (each tier builds on previous)
‚úÖ Database tracks animation watched status (lvl1anim - lvl5anim)

**Ready to Test:**
- Restart frontend dev server
- Test complete flow from tier 1 through tier 5
- Verify page refresh maintains unlocked nodes
- Verify continuous animation flow

## üìù Notes:

- Each level JSON file contains ALL nodes from that tier's view
- The `level` property on each node determines when it animates
- Watched levels (lvlXanim = 1) show immediately without animation
- Current level nodes animate when "Start Animation" clicked
- System uses `getLevelData(currentLevel)` to switch JSON files based on user tier
