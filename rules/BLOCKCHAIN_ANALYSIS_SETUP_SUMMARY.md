# Blockchain Analysis Form Integration - Setup Complete! 🎉

## What's Been Implemented

Your backend is now fully configured to receive JotForm submissions and automatically create user accounts with email notifications.

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

When someone submits your JotForm at: **https://form.jotform.com/252641345597060**

1. **Form Submission** → JotForm sends data to your backend
2. **User Creation** → New user account is automatically created
3. **Email Sent** → Welcome email with login credentials is sent
4. **Analysis Request** → Blockchain analysis request is saved and linked to user
5. **Response** → Success confirmation sent back to JotForm

## 🔗 **API Endpoint**

**POST** `/blockchain-analysis/submit`

This endpoint:
- Receives JotForm JSON data
- Creates user account (if doesn't exist)
- Sends welcome email with login credentials
- Saves blockchain analysis request
- Links request to user account
- Returns success response

## 📧 **Email Integration**

Uses your existing email service (`utils/email.service.js`) to send:
- Welcome message
- Login credentials (email + auto-generated password)
- Security reminder
- Platform access instructions

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### BlockchainAnalysis Model:
- Personal info (name, email)
- Wallet details (address, network, loss info)
- File uploads (transaction receipts)
- JotForm metadata (submission ID, IP, timestamp)
- User account link (`userId`)
- Status tracking and internal notes

### User Model Integration:
- Links analysis requests to user accounts
- Maintains existing user functionality
- Supports existing authentication system

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
# Start your server first
npm run dev

# Then in another terminal
node test-blockchain-analysis.js
```

## 📋 **JotForm Configuration**

1. Go to your JotForm → Integrations → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `http://your-domain.com/blockchain-analysis/submit`
3. Set method: POST
4. Set content type: application/json

## 🔧 **Environment Requirements**

Make sure your `.env` file has email configuration:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

EMAIL_FROM=CFinder <your_email@gmail.com>
```

## 📊 **Response Format**

Success response includes:
```json
