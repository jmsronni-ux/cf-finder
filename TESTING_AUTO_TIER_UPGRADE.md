# Testing Auto Tier Upgrade on Withdrawal

## How to Test the Feature

### Prerequisites
1. User account that is not at max tier (tier < 5)
2. User has sufficient balance to make a withdrawal
3. Admin access to approve withdrawal requests

### Test Scenario 1: Successful Auto Tier Upgrade

**Steps:**
1. Log in as a regular user (not admin)
2. Navigate to Dashboard or Profile
3. Click "Withdraw" button
4. Fill in withdrawal form:
   - Enter amount (less than or equal to balance)
   - Enter wallet address
5. Click "Submit Request"
6. **Keep the popup open** (don't close it)
7. Log in as admin in another browser/tab
8. Go to admin panel â†’ Withdraw Requests
9. Find the pending withdrawal request
10. Approve the request (add admin wallet and confirmed amount)
11. Switch back to user's browser/tab

**Expected Results:**
- Within 3-6 seconds, the popup should change to "Request Approved!" state
- You should see a success toast notification: "ðŸŽ‰ Tier upgrade request for [Next Tier Name] automatically submitted!"
- The popup shows payment instructions
- User can navigate to Profile to see pending tier request status

### Test Scenario 2: User Already at Max Tier

**Steps:**
1. Log in as user with tier 5
2. Complete withdrawal process (steps 1-11 from Scenario 1)

**Expected Results:**
- Withdrawal approval shows success
- NO tier upgrade request is submitted (console shows "User is at max tier or user not found")
- No tier upgrade toast notification appears

### Test Scenario 3: User Already Has Pending Tier Request

**Steps:**
1. Log in as regular user (tier < 5)
2. Manually submit a tier upgrade request from Profile
3. Complete withdrawal process (steps 1-11 from Scenario 1)

**Expected Results:**
- Withdrawal approval shows success
- Tier upgrade is attempted but silently fails (console shows "User already has a pending tier request")
- No error toast shown to user (graceful handling)

### Test Scenario 4: Popup Closed During Pending State

**Steps:**
1. Start withdrawal process
2. Close popup while request is pending
3. Reopen withdraw popup
4. Admin approves the request

**Expected Results:**
- Popup resumes pending state when reopened
- When approved, tier upgrade request is submitted
- Success toast appears

## What to Look For

### Console Logs
- âœ… "User is at max tier or user not found" (if tier 5)
- âœ… "User already has a pending tier request" (if duplicate)
- âœ… Any fetch errors are logged but don't disrupt user experience

### Toast Notifications
- âœ… "Request submitted! Waiting for admin approval..." (withdrawal pending)
- âœ… "ðŸŽ‰ Tier upgrade request for [Tier Name] automatically submitted!" (on approval)
- âœ… No error toasts for tier upgrade failures (graceful)

### User Profile After Test
- Navigate to Profile page
- Check "Tier Status" section
- Should see yellow "Pending Upgrade Request" badge (if successful)
- Request details should show the automatically submitted tier request

## Edge Cases Covered

âœ… User at max tier - skips tier upgrade  
âœ… Duplicate tier request - silently ignores  
âœ… Network errors - logged but not shown to user  
âœ… Multiple withdrawals - ref flag prevents duplicates  
âœ… Popup close/reopen - state persists correctly  
âœ… No next tier available - gracefully skips  

## Success Criteria

The feature is working correctly if:
1. âœ… Tier upgrade request is automatically submitted on withdrawal approval
2. âœ… User sees success notification
3. âœ… No duplicate requests are created
4. âœ… Max tier users don't get tier upgrade attempts
5. âœ… Errors are handled gracefully without disrupting UX
6. âœ… Pending tier request appears in Profile
